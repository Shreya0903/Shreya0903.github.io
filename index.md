<h2>About</h2>
<div class="card reveal">
I began as an electronics engineer, fascinated by how things work.  
At BUâ€™s STEM M.S. in Management, I found my spark: <span class="soft">turning research into market moves</span>.  
Whether building a Power BI dashboard, aligning a cross-functional team, or framing a go-to-market plan, I care about clarity and results.
