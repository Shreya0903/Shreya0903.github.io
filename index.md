# Hi, I’m **Shreya Barman** 👋

I love using data and strategy to make ideas real.  
I’m currently pursuing an **M.S. in Management at Boston University** and I’ve enjoyed internships and projects in **digital marketing, product strategy, and project management**.  

When I’m not working with numbers and roadmaps, you’ll probably find me **sketching, dancing, or planning my next trip**.  
These experiences keep me curious and creative—and they help me bring a human touch to every project.

> I’m looking for analyst or associate project/product manager roles where I can help teams **launch smart ideas and keep work joyful**.

## What I’m good at
1. Turning research and data into clear, persuasive strategies  
2. Coordinating cross-functional projects and making deadlines fun to hit  
3. Building dashboards and visuals (Tableau, Power BI, Excel) that people actually use
