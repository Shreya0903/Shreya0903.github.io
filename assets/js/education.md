<h3>Teaching Assistant – Market Insights (Spring 2025)</h3>
Only two students in the entire cohort were selected for this role, and I was honored to be one of them.  
I partnered closely with Professor King to shape weekly discussions, design assignments, and provide one-on-one guidance to classmates.  
Beyond grading and course logistics, I helped bridge academia and practice by inviting industry professionals to share real-world perspectives on customer research and data-driven strategy.  
This role strengthened my ability to translate concepts into action and to mentor peers—skills I carry into every project.
